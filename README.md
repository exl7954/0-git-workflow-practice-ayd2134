# "Itâ€™s the End of Computer Programming as We Know It. (And I Feel Fine.)" by Farhad Manjoo

## Here is the [URL](https://nytimes.com/2023/06/02/opinion/ai-coding.html?searchResultPosition=4) of the article that I found interesting.

I found this article interesting because the author shares his own experience as a lifelong coder and as a software engineer, as well as his own insight on the emergence of artificial intelligence and its role in replacing human software engineers. The article presents a bleak outlook on the software engineering industry and its need for human employees, which personally does little to soothe my fears of finding work and experience after I graduate. However, I am interested in exploring other avenues of computer science as a career that are more involved with human interaction and human psychology, such as UX/UI design or even marketing. This article has (not so subtly) nudged me in that direction, yet I am still eager to learn more about software engineering and how AI plays such a significant role in developing software in the future.
